This project contains two ways to use parralel programming with a Linux operating systems:
	- Processes
	- Threads

The aim of the project is to compute the number of letters in a text file and render a frequency table (with the occurency of each letter).
That kind of algorithm can be used to compress the file with for example the Huffman coding.
